    "essay = \"\"\"Artificial intelligence has emerged as one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century, fundamentally reshaping the landscape of employment across virtually every sector of the global economy. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, their influence on the job market has sparked intense debate about the future of work, raising questions about job displacement, skill requirements, and the very nature of human productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The displacement of traditional roles represents perhaps the most visible impact of AI on employment. Automation powered by machine learning and advanced algorithms has already begun replacing routine, repetitive tasks across manufacturing, customer service, data entry, and administrative functions. Self-checkout systems have reduced the need for cashiers, while AI-powered chatbots handle customer inquiries that once required human representatives. In the financial sector, algorithmic trading and automated loan processing have diminished the demand for certain analytical positions. Transportation faces a particularly dramatic shift, with autonomous vehicle technology threatening to disrupt millions of driving jobs in the coming decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the narrative of AI as purely a job destroyer oversimplifies a more complex reality. History demonstrates that technological revolutions simultaneously destroy and create employment opportunities. The industrial revolution eliminated countless agricultural jobs while spawning entirely new industries and professions. Similarly, AI is generating demand for novel roles that didn't exist a decade ago. Machine learning engineers, AI ethicists, data scientists, prompt engineers, and AI trainers represent just a fraction of the emerging career paths. Moreover, AI is creating indirect employment through the infrastructure, maintenance, and oversight required to support these systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation extends beyond simple replacement to fundamental job augmentation. Many roles are evolving as AI tools enhance human capabilities rather than replace them entirely. Doctors now utilize AI diagnostic tools to improve accuracy, lawyers employ AI for document review and legal research, and marketers leverage AI analytics for consumer insights. This augmentation often shifts human workers toward higher-value tasks requiring creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving—capabilities that remain distinctly human. Radiologists, for instance, increasingly focus on patient consultation and complex case interpretation while AI handles preliminary image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skills demanded by the modern workforce are undergoing rapid evolution in response to AI proliferation. Technical literacy has become essential across professions that previously required minimal technological expertise. Workers must now develop competencies in working alongside AI systems, understanding their capabilities and limitations, and interpreting AI-generated insights. Simultaneously, uniquely human skills—critical thinking, emotional intelligence, creativity, ethical judgment, and interpersonal communication—have gained heightened importance precisely because they're difficult to automate. The premium on adaptability and continuous learning has never been higher, as workers must regularly update their skills to remain relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation has created significant challenges around workforce transition and inequality. Workers in roles most susceptible to automation often lack the resources, time, or access to retrain for emerging opportunities. The displacement tends to disproportionately affect lower-income workers, potentially exacerbating existing economic inequalities. Older workers face particular difficulties adapting to rapidly changing technological landscapes. Geographic disparities emerge as AI-driven opportunities concentrate in technology hubs, leaving other regions economically vulnerable. These dynamics raise urgent questions about social safety nets, educational systems, and policies to ensure inclusive economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Educational institutions face mounting pressure to prepare students for an AI-integrated future. Traditional curricula emphasizing memorization and routine problem-solving prove increasingly inadequate. Instead, education must foster adaptability, technological fluency, interdisciplinary thinking, and lifelong learning habits. The rise of online learning platforms, ironically often powered by AI, offers new pathways for continuous skill development and career transitions. However, ensuring equitable access to quality education and training remains a persistent challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gig economy and freelance work have expanded partly due to AI platforms that efficiently match workers with short-term opportunities. While offering flexibility, these arrangements often lack the benefits and security of traditional employment, raising concerns about worker protection and economic stability in an AI-mediated labor market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking forward, the trajectory of AI's impact on employment remains uncertain, depending on technological advancement rates, policy decisions, and societal choices about AI deployment. Optimistic scenarios envision AI liberating humans from mundane tasks, enabling focus on creative and meaningful work, and potentially supporting shorter work weeks or universal basic income. Pessimistic projections warn of massive unemployment, economic disruption, and deepening inequality without proactive intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge facing society is not whether AI will impact jobs—it already has—but how we collectively manage this transformation. Success requires coordinated efforts from governments, businesses, educational institutions, and workers themselves. Policies supporting workforce retraining, portable benefits, and social safety nets become crucial. Businesses must invest in employee development and consider the social implications of automation decisions. Educational systems need fundamental reform to emphasize adaptable, future-ready skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, AI's impact on current market jobs is profound, multifaceted, and accelerating. While displacement of certain roles is inevitable, the technology also creates opportunities for augmentation, new career paths, and potentially more fulfilling work. The outcome—whether AI serves as a tool for broadly shared prosperity or a driver of increased inequality and economic disruption—depends largely on the choices we make today. Navigating this transition successfully requires acknowledging both AI's tremendous potential and its risks, while proactively building systems that ensure workers can adapt and thrive in an increasingly automated world. The future of work in the age of AI will ultimately be determined not by the technology itself, but by our collective wisdom in shaping its integration into society.\"\"\""

       "EvaluationSchema(feedback='Overall assessment: The essay is well-written, clear, and professionally presented. It demonstrates strong command of grammar, syntax, and vocabulary, and is logically organized with coherent transitions between paragraphs. The tone is appropriate for an academic/policy audience, and the piece balances nuance—acknowledging both risks and opportunities—with persuasive, measured language.\\n\\nStrengths:\\n- Structure and flow: The essay moves logically from problem statement to impacts, counterarguments, skills and education, socioeconomic implications, and policy recommendations. Paragraphs are focused and transitions are smooth.\\n- Clarity and coherence: Sentences are generally clear and ideas are developed coherently. Key concepts (displacement, augmentation, skills, inequality, policy responses) are consistently and effectively articulated.\\n- Vocabulary and register: Word choice is precise and suitably formal. Technical terms (e.g., “algorithmic trading,” “prompt engineers”) are used appropriately without unnecessary jargon.\\n- Balance and nuance: The essay avoids one-sided claims and situates arguments historically and economically, which strengthens credibility.\\n\\nAreas for improvement:\\n- Redundancy and repetition: Certain phrases and themes are repeated (e.g., multiple iterations of “AI’s impact on employment” and similar statements about displacement/augmentation). Tightening or consolidating some sentences would reduce repetition and improve concision.\\n- Evidence and specificity: The argument would be strengthened by adding specific data, citations, or concrete examples (statistics, case studies, or references) rather than relying primarily on general claims.\\n- Sentence variety and pacing: Many sentences are long and similarly structured; introducing more varied sentence lengths and constructions would enhance readability and rhetorical impact.\\n- Occasional vague or clichéd phrasing: Phrases such as “tremendous potential,” “collective wisdom,” and “broadly shared prosperity” are somewhat generic. More precise wording or concrete proposals would make the conclusion more compelling.\\n- Minor stylistic choices: A few words (for example, “ironically” when describing AI-powered educational platforms) could be reconsidered for tone. Also, the inclusion of less-established job titles (e.g., “prompt engineers”) is fine but could be framed to indicate their emerging status.\\n\\nOverall recommendation: With modest edits to reduce redundancy, add one or two concrete examples or data points, and vary sentence structure, this essay would be an excellent short policy/overview piece. Language quality is high, with room for stylistic tightening and evidence-based enhancement.\\n', score=8)"

       "{'essay': \"Artificial intelligence has emerged as one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century, fundamentally reshaping the landscape of employment across virtually every sector of the global economy. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, their influence on the job market has sparked intense debate about the future of work, raising questions about job displacement, skill requirements, and the very nature of human productivity.\\n\\nThe displacement of traditional roles represents perhaps the most visible impact of AI on employment. Automation powered by machine learning and advanced algorithms has already begun replacing routine, repetitive tasks across manufacturing, customer service, data entry, and administrative functions. Self-checkout systems have reduced the need for cashiers, while AI-powered chatbots handle customer inquiries that once required human representatives. In the financial sector, algorithmic trading and automated loan processing have diminished the demand for certain analytical positions. Transportation faces a particularly dramatic shift, with autonomous vehicle technology threatening to disrupt millions of driving jobs in the coming decades.\\n\\nHowever, the narrative of AI as purely a job destroyer oversimplifies a more complex reality. History demonstrates that technological revolutions simultaneously destroy and create employment opportunities. The industrial revolution eliminated countless agricultural jobs while spawning entirely new industries and professions. Similarly, AI is generating demand for novel roles that didn't exist a decade ago. Machine learning engineers, AI ethicists, data scientists, prompt engineers, and AI trainers represent just a fraction of the emerging career paths. Moreover, AI is creating indirect employment through the infrastructure, maintenance, and oversight required to support these systems.\\n\\nThe transformation extends beyond simple replacement to fundamental job augmentation. Many roles are evolving as AI tools enhance human capabilities rather than replace them entirely. Doctors now utilize AI diagnostic tools to improve accuracy, lawyers employ AI for document review and legal research, and marketers leverage AI analytics for consumer insights. This augmentation often shifts human workers toward higher-value tasks requiring creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving—capabilities that remain distinctly human. Radiologists, for instance, increasingly focus on patient consultation and complex case interpretation while AI handles preliminary image analysis.\\n\\nThe skills demanded by the modern workforce are undergoing rapid evolution in response to AI proliferation. Technical literacy has become essential across professions that previously required minimal technological expertise. Workers must now develop competencies in working alongside AI systems, understanding their capabilities and limitations, and interpreting AI-generated insights. Simultaneously, uniquely human skills—critical thinking, emotional intelligence, creativity, ethical judgment, and interpersonal communication—have gained heightened importance precisely because they're difficult to automate. The premium on adaptability and continuous learning has never been higher, as workers must regularly update their skills to remain relevant.\\n\\nThis transformation has created significant challenges around workforce transition and inequality. Workers in roles most susceptible to automation often lack the resources, time, or access to retrain for emerging opportunities. The displacement tends to disproportionately affect lower-income workers, potentially exacerbating existing economic inequalities. Older workers face particular difficulties adapting to rapidly changing technological landscapes. Geographic disparities emerge as AI-driven opportunities concentrate in technology hubs, leaving other regions economically vulnerable. These dynamics raise urgent questions about social safety nets, educational systems, and policies to ensure inclusive economic growth.\\n\\nEducational institutions face mounting pressure to prepare students for an AI-integrated future. Traditional curricula emphasizing memorization and routine problem-solving prove increasingly inadequate. Instead, education must foster adaptability, technological fluency, interdisciplinary thinking, and lifelong learning habits. The rise of online learning platforms, ironically often powered by AI, offers new pathways for continuous skill development and career transitions. However, ensuring equitable access to quality education and training remains a persistent challenge.\\n\\nThe gig economy and freelance work have expanded partly due to AI platforms that efficiently match workers with short-term opportunities. While offering flexibility, these arrangements often lack the benefits and security of traditional employment, raising concerns about worker protection and economic stability in an AI-mediated labor market.\\n\\nLooking forward, the trajectory of AI's impact on employment remains uncertain, depending on technological advancement rates, policy decisions, and societal choices about AI deployment. Optimistic scenarios envision AI liberating humans from mundane tasks, enabling focus on creative and meaningful work, and potentially supporting shorter work weeks or universal basic income. Pessimistic projections warn of massive unemployment, economic disruption, and deepening inequality without proactive intervention.\\n\\nThe challenge facing society is not whether AI will impact jobs—it already has—but how we collectively manage this transformation. Success requires coordinated efforts from governments, businesses, educational institutions, and workers themselves. Policies supporting workforce retraining, portable benefits, and social safety nets become crucial. Businesses must invest in employee development and consider the social implications of automation decisions. Educational systems need fundamental reform to emphasize adaptable, future-ready skills.\\n\\nIn conclusion, AI's impact on current market jobs is profound, multifaceted, and accelerating. While displacement of certain roles is inevitable, the technology also creates opportunities for augmentation, new career paths, and potentially more fulfilling work. The outcome—whether AI serves as a tool for broadly shared prosperity or a driver of increased inequality and economic disruption—depends largely on the choices we make today. Navigating this transition successfully requires acknowledging both AI's tremendous potential and its risks, while proactively building systems that ensure workers can adapt and thrive in an increasingly automated world. The future of work in the age of AI will ultimately be determined not by the technology itself, but by our collective wisdom in shaping its integration into society.\",\n",
       " 'language_feedback': 'Overall impression: The essay is well-structured, fluent, and written in a clear, formal academic register. It demonstrates strong control of grammar and vocabulary, logical progression of ideas, effective paragraphing, and balanced treatment of the topic (explaining both displacement and augmentation, and including policy/education implications). Transitions between paragraphs are smooth and the conclusion effectively summarizes the argument.\\n\\nStrengths:\\n- Organization: Each paragraph has a clear topic and the essay follows a coherent arc (problem → nuance → implications → recommendations → conclusion).\\n- Clarity and coherence: Sentences are generally clear and ideas are logically connected; the writer maintains a consistent, appropriate tone.\\n- Vocabulary and register: Word choice is precise and formal; technical terms are used correctly without being jargon-heavy.\\n- Balance and nuance: The essay avoids hyperbole and acknowledges complexity; it integrates social and policy considerations well.\\n\\nAreas for improvement:\\n- Redundancy and repetition: Several ideas are repeated in slightly different words (e.g., the inevitability of AI’s impact, the need for retraining, and the contrast between destruction and creation of jobs). Tightening or combining similar sentences would improve concision.\\n- Wordiness and long sentences: Some sentences are lengthy and could be split for emphasis and readability. Reducing nominalizations (e.g., “the displacement of traditional roles represents perhaps the most visible impact”) and choosing active constructions would strengthen prose.\\n- Specificity and evidence: The essay relies on general statements and examples; adding a few concrete data points, citations, or brief case studies would increase persuasive power and credibility.\\n- Stylistic variety: The essay repeatedly uses “AI” as the subject; varying sentence openings and substituting synonyms occasionally would improve rhythm. A few phrases verge on cliché (e.g., “the future of work”); replacing them with more specific language could sharpen the argument.\\n\\nSuggested edits (practical):\\n- Combine or trim paragraphs that reiterate the same point about job loss vs. job creation.\\n- Break up some long sentences into shorter ones to improve pacing.\\n- Replace a couple of general claims with brief statistics or a named example (e.g., a study, report, or company use case).\\n- Use active voice where possible and reduce nominalizations to make assertions more direct.\\n\\nOverall assessment: Strongly written and well argued; with modest tightening for concision and the addition of a few concrete details, it would be excellent.\\n',\n",
       " 'analysis_feedback': 'Overall assessment: The essay offers a clear, well-structured high-level survey of how AI is reshaping work. It correctly identifies key themes—displacement, augmentation, new job creation, skill shifts, inequality, education, gig work, and the role of policy—and provides relevant examples (e.g., chatbots, self-checkout, radiology). The prose is coherent and balanced, acknowledging both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.\\n\\nStrengths:\\n- Comprehensive topical coverage: touches on the major channels through which AI affects employment (automation, augmentation, new roles, skills, geography, inequality, education, and policy).\\n- Balanced framing: recognizes historical precedent and avoids simplistic “AI destroys jobs” rhetoric.\\n- Good use of illustrative examples to make abstract points concrete.\\n- Clear policy-relevant concluding recommendations calling for coordinated action.\\n\\nLimitations in depth of analysis (opportunities for improvement):\\n- Lack of empirical grounding: the essay makes many plausible claims but cites no data, studies, or quantitative projections (e.g., projected job losses/gains, affected occupations, time horizons, regional impacts). Adding empirical evidence would strengthen credibility.\\n- Limited engagement with mechanisms: it largely describes outcomes without deeper analysis of economic mechanisms (e.g., demand-side effects, task-based substitution vs. complementarity, wages, labor demand elasticities, productivity-productivity paradox, or how AI adoption differs across firm sizes/sectors).\\n- Insufficient sectoral nuance: some sectors (healthcare, transportation, finance) are mentioned, but the essay could go deeper into which tasks within occupations are automatable, adoption rates, regulatory constraints, and timelines (e.g., why autonomous trucking faces regulatory and technical barriers that delay mass displacement).\\n- Sparse policy detail: recommendations are high-level (retraining, portable benefits, social safety nets) but lack discussion of specific policy designs, funding mechanisms, trade-offs, pilot programs, or international examples of success/failure.\\n- Missing discussion of distributional and political economy dynamics: the essay notes inequality risks but does not explore firm incentives, lobbying, tax and labor market institutions, or how power asymmetries shape outcomes.\\n- No theoretical or empirical anchors: frameworks and literature that could deepen analysis (task-based approach, Autor/Acemoglu/Brynjolfsson debates, OECD/ILO/McKinsey reports) are not engaged.\\n- Limited metrics and measurement suggestions: no proposal for how to measure AI’s labor-market impact (e.g., task-routineness indices, job churn, vacancy-to-unemployment ratios, regional labor flows).\\n\\nConcrete suggestions to deepen the analysis:\\n1. Add empirical evidence and citations: include projections and empirical studies (e.g., Autor, Acemoglu and Restrepo, Brynjolfsson & McAfee, OECD/ILO reports, McKinsey) to quantify risks and opportunities.\\n2. Use a task-based framework: analyze occupations by task content (routine vs. non-routine cognitive/interactive tasks) to show which jobs are most exposed and why.\\n3. Provide sector case studies: pick 2–3 sectors and analyze specific tasks, adoption barriers, timelines, and secondary effects (e.g., health care: diagnostic augmentation vs. admin automation; transport: autonomous trucks and regulatory hurdles).\\n4. Examine macroeconomic channels: discuss productivity effects, demand creation, potential for new industries, wage impacts, and how compensation might change.\\n5. Elaborate policy design: specify retraining models (income support + earn-and-learn), financing options, incentives for firms to reskill, portable benefits mechanics, targeted regional policies, and evaluation metrics.\\n6. Address political economy: explain who gains and who loses, likely resistance, and governance mechanisms to steer outcomes.\\n7. Propose measurement and research agenda: what datasets and indicators should researchers and policymakers track?\\n8. Cite examples of programs or countries (e.g., active labor market policies in Scandinavia, apprenticeships in Germany, digital skills initiatives) to ground recommendations.\\n\\nSuggested score: 7/10. The essay is a strong, well-written overview appropriate for a general audience, but it remains high-level. To merit a higher score it would need deeper theoretical engagement, empirical support, more granular sectoral analysis, and concrete, implementable policy designs.',\n",
       " 'clarity_feedback': 'Overall assessment:\\nThis is a strong, well-structured essay with a clear, appropriate academic tone. The argument is coherent and develops logically from problem statement through evidence to policy recommendations. Vocabulary is varied and precise, paragraphing is effective, and transitions between ideas are smooth. Grammar and punctuation are accurate; there are no distracting errors.\\n\\nStrengths:\\n- Organization: The essay follows a logical progression (problem → examples → consequences → skills/education → policy), making it easy to follow.\\n- Clarity and coherence: Sentences are generally clear and the paragraphs develop single, focused ideas.\\n- Tone and register: The formal, balanced tone suits the topic well and conveys nuance without overstating claims.\\n- Vocabulary and diction: Uses appropriate technical and general vocabulary (e.g., “augmentation,” “algorithmic trading,” “portable benefits”) without becoming jargon-heavy.\\n- Evidence and examples: Concrete examples (self-checkout, chatbots, radiologists) effectively illustrate abstract claims.\\n\\nAreas for improvement (language-focused):\\n- Repetition and redundancy: A few ideas and phrases recur (e.g., “displacement,” “transformation,” “AI’s impact on employment”), which weakens emphasis. Tighten or vary wording to avoid repetition.\\n- Sentence length and rhythm: Several long, multi-clause sentences could be split to improve readability and pace. Varying sentence length would enhance engagement.\\n- Wordiness/nominalization: Occasional nominalizations and abstractions (e.g., “the transformation extends beyond simple replacement to fundamental job augmentation”) could be made more direct—use verbs where possible.\\n- Slightly vague language in places: Phrases like “tremendous potential” or “collective wisdom” are rhetorically effective but imprecise; consider replacing with more specific claims or concrete outcomes.\\n- Active vs. passive voice: While not a major issue, judicious use of active voice can increase impact (“Governments must fund retraining programs” instead of “Policies supporting workforce retraining... become crucial”).\\n\\nConcrete edits / examples:\\n- Tighten an overly long sentence: instead of “The displacement of traditional roles represents perhaps the most visible impact of AI on employment,” try “Displacement of traditional roles is the most visible impact of AI on employment.”\\n- Split for clarity: change “This augmentation often shifts human workers toward higher-value tasks requiring creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving—capabilities that remain distinctly human.” to two sentences: “This augmentation shifts workers toward higher-value tasks that require creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving. These capabilities remain distinctively human.”\\n- Reduce repetition by varying wording: replace a repeated “transformation” with synonyms like “shift,” “evolution,” or “transition,” depending on nuance.\\n\\nOverall score: 9/10—an articulate, polished essay that would benefit from small edits for concision, sentence variety, and reduced repetition to reach near perfection.',\n",
